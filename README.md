# Introduction.

This code generates snow properties by applying the SPIReS algorithm v2025.0.1, derived from the [original SPIReS code](https://github.com/edwardbair/SPIRES) (Bair et al., 2021) and [SPIReS v2024.1.0](https://github.com/RittgerLabGroup/SPIRES_2024_1_0) to the MOD09GA product (Vermotte and Wolfe, 2021).

The algorithm produces daily raster images of snow cover and snow surface properties. The algorithm unmix Snow cover, grain size and dust concentration from the daily reflectance of the MOD09GA Terra Collection 6 v061 (Vermote and Wolfe, 2021) using this adapted version of the SPIReS algorithm (Bair et al., 2021) that we named SPIReS v2025.0.1, with a removal of clouds and data errors. Then the data are temporally interpolated to fill the cloudy days, and the snow cover duration is calculated from the start of the water year (October 1st). Deltavis, radiative forcing, and albedos are calculated using an adaptation of the ParBal algorithm (Bair et al., 2018), that we included in SPIReS v2025.0.1.

For this purpose, the code first downloads the MOD09GA files for any region. Then, it carried out the different steps of the SPIReS algorithm v2025.0.1. The output files consist of netcdf files with values for snow variables per modis tile and day, and statistic files used by the [snow-today website](https://nsidc.org/snow-today/snow-viewer).
