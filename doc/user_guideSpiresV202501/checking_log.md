# Checking logs and incident analysis.

This page explains how to check the correct execution of the submitted jobs by investigating logs.

Note that slurm's exit status for a job is not a guarantee that the job correctly executed, in part because of the complexity of the scripts.

## Preamble.

All monitoring and step jobs have log files centralized in a location determined by the environment variable `$espLogDir` in `~/.bashrc` (see [here](install.md)

Given a slurm cluster, this location **must** be the same for all users of the project.

This project has three types of jobs/scripts:
- submission scripts. Written in bash and run on a login node, with an output on the shell.
- monitoring script. Written in bash and run on slurm cluster, with 2 log file output for all regions covered, per period requested.
- step script. Written in bash, Matlab, with .csv configuration files and .nc templates, run on slurm cluster, with 1 log file output per region and period requested.

More info on [code organization](code_organization.md)

## Submission scripts.

The submission scripts [run_nrt_pipeline](run_nrt_pipeline.md) and [run_historic_step](run_historic_step.md) display their info on the shell. If the submission to slurm is successful, they'll display the jobIds of the monitoring job(s) they submitted to slurm:
```
2024
Submitted batch job 19647584
14:04:59: DONE submission.
```
Here the jobId of the monitoring job is `19647584`.

For historic runs, the year of data generated is also indicated (or water year, depending the step), here `2024`.

## Monitoring scripts (runSubmitter.sh).

Monitoring jobs are submitted using the submission scripts above. One main script `bash/runSubmitter.sh` is used for these jobs, with ancillary scripts of filepath pattern `bash/tools***.sh`.

### Real time.

The real time monitoring of a monitoring script job can be carried out with:
```bash
gLog # alias in .bashrc going to the log directory.
tail -f *19647584*.out
```
if the jobId is `19647584`.

This log records the status of the step jobs submitted for each tile, typically:
```
Synthesis:
date      ; dura.; script  ; job     ; obj.; cell; date         ; status   ; hostname       ; CPU%; mem%; cores; totalMem; message
.....................................................................
0429T20:45; 00:04; mod09gaI; 19649891;  292;     ; 2025-04-29-2 ; end:DONE ; bgpu-ivc2      ; 1%; 2%; 1; 1 GB; Exit=0, matlab=0, Matlab executed.
0429T20:42; 00:01; mod09gaI; 19649892;  293;     ; 2025-04-29-2 ; start    ; bgpu-ivc2      ; ; ; 1; 1 GB; 
0429T20:42; 00:01; mod09gaI; 19649893;  328;     ; 2025-04-29-2 ; start    ; bgpu-ivc2      ; ; ; 1; 1 GB; 
0429T20:44; 00:03; mod09gaI; 19649894;  329;     ; 2025-04-29-2 ; end:DONE ; bgpu-ivc2      ; 1%; 2%; 1; 1 GB; Exit=0, matlab=0, Matlab executed.
0429T20:48; 00:07; mod09gaI; 19649890;  364;     ; 2025-04-29-2 ; end:DONE ; bgpu-ivc2      ; 1%; 2%; 1; 1 GB; Exit=0, matlab=0, Matlab executed.

Jobs done: 3/5.
```
Which here indicates that for the step mod09gaI, 3 step jobs are been achieved and 2 jobs are still in execution.

### After execution.

Once the monitoring job has successfully achieved the full sequential series of steps (for the near-real-time pipeline) or the group of jobs associated to a specific step (for historic runs), the log file displays:
```
#############################################################################
Absence of begin in submit line. No submit schedule for repeated job.
#############################################################################
```

Note that in some rare cases, this line can be displayed even if a step job has been in error.

When not displayed, the monitoring can be affected by an issue by repeatingly resubmitting a job in error, with the new iteration falling back again in error either because of a bug in the project code, or of a hardware/software issue with the slurm cluster, notably with connections. While the code handles many cases now, there's still some work in progress.

A .csv file lists all the jobs executed and their result. To read it:
```bash
gLog
cat *19647584*.csv
```


### After execution for historics.

When you run historics, if you submit a lot of monitoring jobs, you can see their results rapidly using the commands above on a **login** node, and after going to the root of the project and loading the slurm cluster tool module:
```bash
cd ${thisEspProjectDir} # $thisEspProjectDir defined in .matlabEnvironmentVariableV, either in env/, or in your home.
ml slurm/xxx
source shared/sh/toolsJobs.sh
get_log_status_for_submit_historics sCRa5 1964
```
which will give the output:
```
xxx/sCRa524_1_19640553.out; COMPLETED; Jobs done: 5/5.
xxx/sCRa524_1_19647665.out; COMPLETED; Jobs done: 5/5.
xxx/sCRa524_1_19649865.out; COMPLETED; Jobs done: 5/5.
xxx/sCRa525_1_19649915.out; COMPLETED; Jobs done: 5/5.
```
Here we asked the result for all monitoring job having a job name containing the pattern `sCRa5` (list of monitoring jobnames in variable `$submitScriptIdJobNames` in `bash/submitHistoric.sh`) and with monitoring jobId starting by `1964`. The output shows that all jobs have been successfully achieved.

## Step scripts.

The same log file is used by the bash and matlab code.

### Real time.

The real time monitoring of a step script job can be carried out with:
```bash
gLog
tail -f *292*19647585*.out
```
if the arrayJobId is `19647585` and the id of the region/tile is `292` (list of ids in `conf/configuration_of_regions.csv`).

Note that the filename includes that arrayJobId and not the jobId (the jobId appears in the column `job` of the array listing the status of every job. 

The list of step arrayJobIds is available in the log file of the monitoring job (see above), in lines:
`Creation of arrayJobIds with parent 19647585`, if the arrayJobId is `19647585`.

A list of jobs in execution is also available using on a login node, after loading the slurm cluster tool module:
```bash
ml slurm/xxx
squeue # alias defined in .bashrc
```

For scripts calling Matlab, it's possible to get the set of instructions given to Matlab using:
```bash
gLog
cat *292*19647585*.out | grep "Matlab string" -A 50
```
Convenient to debug the code on a Matlab interactive session.

### After execution.

After execution, an array synthetizing the achievement status is displayed at the end of the log.
```
Date      ; dura.; script  ; job     ; obj.; cel.; date         ; status   ; hostname       ; CPU%; mem%; cores; totalMem; message
.....................................................................
0430T11:16; 00:03; daMosaic; 19650471;  328;     ; 2025-01-31-4 ; end:DONE ; bmem-rico1     ; 11%; 26%; 32; 120 GB; Exit=0, matlab=0, Matlab executed.
```
for instance for a jobId `19650471`.

The status `end:DONE` is what confirms that the job correctly exectuted. This array is get by the monitoring script/job to synthesize the status of all the jobs.

## Archiving of logs.

It is advised that logs older than 1 month be archived in a permanent location having enough space, for instance `$espArchiveDirNrt/logs`, with `$espArchiveDirNrt` an archive location defined in `.bashrc`. 

## Incident analysis through log investigation

Production incident 06/27/2025
Procedure to identify the step triggering the incident and collect a level 2 information.
```bash
# 1. Get runSubmitter logs for the last 24 h.
gLog # cd to the central location of the logs.
find . -mtime -1 | grep stnr
```
```

# NB: this can show several logs if several runSubmitter executed.
```

```bash
# 2. Get the exit result of the runSubmitter log.

# Here we see that the step fails on a permission denied from the nusnow server. This might be linked to either (1) bad credentials for the user, (2) saturated storage space on the nusnow server, or (3) transient/permanent connection issues in the nusnow server.
```

So, here, for this incident, the level 2 information could be synthesized as following:
Near real time pipeline failed repeatedly on step `webExpn` last night. The issue is a permission denied from the nusnow server, which needs further investigation from Level 1 or other at NSIDC (check if they scp something to the nusnow with their credentials + storage space on nusnow + issues in the nusnow server).
