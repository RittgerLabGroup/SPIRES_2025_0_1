# Code organization.

This page gives information about the organization of the code of the project.

The code has been developed within what I called the snow-today application and uses a number of scripts, classes, and configuration files common with other projects.

## Code methodological approach.

This section develops the theoretical approach that I carried out to organize the code, while the section [Code directories](#code-directories) gives specific indications about the location of the code and names of some specific scripts or groups of scripts.

### Diversity of code files.

Initially, the code for SPIReS v2025.0.1 was developed as a large set of MATLAB function scripts in a project called [SPIReS](https://github.com/edwardbair/SPIRES/releases/tag/v1.3) and mainly focused on runs on an individual machine. We developed a second version named [SPIReS v2024.1.0](https://github.com/RittgerLabGroup/SPIRES_2024_1_0) and v2025.0.1 is derived from that version.

This project does *not* delegate the core of spectral unmixing calculations and interpolation to [SPIReS](https://github.com/edwardbair/SPIRES/releases/tag/v1.3).

For albedo calculation, this project also delegates a couple of functions to another external MATLAB package [ParBal](https://github.com/edwardbair/ParBal).

The new code presented in this project includes:

1. **submitter**: Bash scripts that interface the submission of the near real-time pipeline or the generation of historical data between the user and Slurm.

2. **runSubmitter**: Bash script that divides the work submitted by a **submitter** into individual tasks, submits these tasks as jobs to Slurm, controls their correct achievement, and handles resubmission if possible/necessary to Slurm.

3. **runStep**: A set of Bash scripts that carry out one of the specific tasks given by **runSubmitter**. They load/determine the configuration and give a set of instructions to MATLAB to carry out the task, or if implemented, carry out the task without calling MATLAB. These scripts are helped by utility scripts **tool** that cover the work common to all steps.

4. **Matlab**: 
    1. MATLAB function scripts that were derived from this initial code to handle the generation of both the near real-time and historical data in a uniform way.

    2. MATLAB tool classes that allow handling:
      - data writing/reading, including configuration files and ancillary data, file naming (class `ESPEnv`, would be better renamed `DataManager`), satellite sensor parametering (class `MODISData`, would be better renamed `SensorManager`), and tile and raster handling (class `Regions`),
      - some functionalities that are more specific to SPIReS but shared among versions of SPIReS: import of NASA products, generation of raster NetCDF/GeoTIFF, statistic calculations, and export to the Snow-Today web app.

### Code interactions within a submission to Slurm.

The code bricks presented [above](#diversity-of-code-files) interact this way when a user executes a **submitter** Bash script in a login session:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    submitter-->>+Slurm: here a work to carry out
    Slurm-->>submitter: Submitted
    Slurm-->>+runSubmitter: Congrats! you can start your duty
    runSubmitter-->>runSubmitter: Split the work in tasks and submit first task
    runSubmitter-->>+runStep: run the task
    runStep-->>runStep: determine parameters and if task requires Matlab
    runStep-->>runStep: submit next runStep if required (pipeline)
    runStep-->>+Matlab: execute these commands
    Matlab-->>Matlab: run
    Matlab-->>runStep: Done
    runStep-->>runSubmitter: Done
    runSubmitter-->runSubmitter: Check that all tasks have been carried out
    runSubmitter-->runSubmitter: If not, resubmit a call to runStep
    runSubmitter-->Slurm: I'm done!
```

An extensive set of environmental variables (around 50 for SPIReS v2025.0.1) is defined in the project. Most are only used by the Bash scripts, but a small amount is also used in the MATLAB scripts and facilitates the communication between the Bash scripts and the MATLAB scripts.


## Code directories.

### Within repository.

With the exception of the files in `env/` and `home/` (see [install](install.md)), or only for advanced use, not for production of data, files within this project repository should not be edited.

#### bash/ and bashSpiresV202501/.

Contains all the Bash scripts that handle the submission and monitoring of Slurm jobs for the daily generation with the near real-time pipeline or the generation of historics.

In particular:
- `configuration.sh`, specific to this project, which set parameters for the near real-time pipeline.
- the `tools*.sh` series + runSubmitter.sh, shared with other projects, which handle the submission and monitoring of Slurm jobs. In addition, runRsync.sh is used to sync files from scratch to archive and vice versa. All these files **must not** be updated without coordination with other projects.
- the `run*.sh` scripts, which handle the specificities of each step of the NRT pipeline or the generation of historics. Most scripts are shared with other versions of SPIReS (and so these files **must not** be updated without coordination with other SPIReS versions).

Referring to the [code methodological approach](#diversity-of-code-files), the scripts:
- **submitter** are `bash/submitNrt.sh` and `bash/submitHistoric.sh`,
- **runSubmitter** is `bash/runSubmitter.sh`,
- **runStep** are the remaining scripts starting by `run`, for example, `bash/runGetMod09gaFiles.sh`. The list of runStep scripts is given in `bash/configurationSpiresV202501.sh`. Scripts specific to SPIReS v2025.0.1 are in `bashSpiresV202501`.
- **tool** are the scripts starting with `tools`, for example, `bash/toolsStart.sh`.

#### conf/.

Contains .csv configuration files that are loaded as tables with the `ESPEnv.m` and `Regions.m` scripts. Allows the advanced user to configure the file patterns, the step parameters (called here filters), the versions, the region parameters, the land subdivisions, the variables, etc.

Most configuration is generic. Configuration files specific to SPIReS v2025.0.1 exist, for instance `configuration_of_versionsvariablesSpiresV202501.csv`, and are named based on the initial file default to Snow-Today, `[previous_name_without_extension]SpiresV202501[extension]`.

Editing of these configuration files is not recommended for data production and is reserved for advanced use.

#### doc/.

This directory contains the documentation of the project (in `doc/user_guideSpiresV202501/`), written in Markdown. Some of this documentation is a copy of documentation for other projects that are developed within the Snow-Yoday application.

#### env/.

Contains the project configuration file `.matlabEnvironmentVariablesSpiresV202501`. This file should be edited for [installation](install.md).

#### external/.

This directory contains the code of the Inpaint_nans external package, used to spatially fill the gaps in the input product (mod09ga).

#### home/.

Contains environment variable and alias files that should be positioned (and edited, see [installation](install.md)) in the home directory of the user, for Linux. A version for Windows is not available.


#### matlab/ and matlabSpiresV202501/.

Contains .m script files, which do the actual calculations for SPIReS core and peripheral steps. Some are classes. Others are function files carrying out utilities. Scripts specific to SPIReS v2025.0.1 are in `matlabSpiresV202501/`.

*Warning*
This version of SPIReS does not use external function scripts, except for the [ParBal package](#diversity_of_code_files).

#### template/.

Contains the .cdl templates of the [output NetCDF](output_netcdf.md).

### Outside repository, ancillary data.

#### Ancillary data.

Information is [here](install.md#ancillary-data).

## Appendices.

The list is not exhaustive, with ~10 configuration files to document in addition.
 
In this list, only bashrc and netrc are located in the user's Linux home directory and automatically accessible during a session; the rest of the files are located in the user's local repository (relative path is indicated based on the root directory of this repository), and are loaded by the code of the project.

Types of configuration files:
- Linux: the lowest level of configuration, which is automatically loads when the user starts a session.
- Bash: Bash scripts of this project use this configuration.
- Matlab: Matlab scripts of this project use this configuration.
